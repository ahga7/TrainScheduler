/*first train ran at 3am
runs every 17 mins
current time is 7:12pm
how many mins away is the next train


get the difference between the two times =16 hours
convert the hours into minutes =972 mins
divide the minutes by train run time which will give you the number of trains that have run within this time= 972/17= 57.176
drop the 57 which gives you .176 * 17 which gives you 2.9999 minutes, so 17mins minus 3, will give you 14 mins till the next train*/
